This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify fraudulent bank accounts from a given dataset. The dataset contains various features that help distinguish between legitimate and fake accounts.

To enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy, different values of K are tested, and the optimal parameter is selected to minimize classification errors. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation using performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

This implementation provides insights into how KNN can be applied to fraud detection and highlights the importance of parameter tuning for improving predictive performance.
